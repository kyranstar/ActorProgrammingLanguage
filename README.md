BasicProgrammingLanguage
========================
This is a programming language that was originally going to be based around actors, but I've since changed my mind. 

Todo list:
  - [x] Built in data types: Number, Boolean, List, Char
  - [x] Primitive operators
    - [ ] Multiple levels of operator precedence
  - [x] First class functions
  - [ ] Library functions
  - [x] Ranges
  - [ ] Macros a la lisp
  - [ ] Compile type checking
    - [ ] Optional type declarations on function parameters, function creations
    - [ ] All assignments after that must be checked
  - [ ] Exceptions
  - [x] User created data types and structures
