Todo list:
  - [x] Built in data types: Number, Boolean, List, Char
  - [x] Primitive operators
  - [x] First class functions
  - [ ] Library functions
  - [x] Ranges
  - [ ] Macros a la lisp
  - [ ] Compile type checking
    - [ ] Type inference
  - [ ] Exceptions
  - [ ] User created data types and structures
